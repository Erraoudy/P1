Recognizing this imperative, ONDE established a Listening Centre in November 1999 to enable child victims and others to report cases of violence or exploitation. The center offers integrated services, ranging from the reception of complaints to medical and legal support, through its various working tools. These include the toll-free number "0800002511", launched by Her Royal Highness Princess Lalla Meryem on 25 November 1999. In addition to the toll-free number 0800002511, the Listening Center has expanded its working tools with a shortened number "2511" in order to make it easier to remember for the general public.',

    'participation.description1' => 'Every citizen has the right to participate in the decision-making process. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by Morocco in June 1993, enshrines this right to participation by children, including those with disabilities. It was with this in mind that ONDE established the Children\'s Parliament on 25 May 1999, which is now a genuine school for initiation into democratic and civic life. Each child expresses his or her point of view on issues that concern him or her, thus developing his or her dialogue and argumentation skills. In particular, they can express their views on government strategies or draft legislation dealing with children\'s issues. Regional and national sessions are the meeting point for their participation in civic life. Previous editions have been marked by the reading of a royal letter, which represents a real roadmap for these young parliamentarians.',

    'observatoire.description' => 'The scattered nature of the data and information on the situation of children in Morocco may hamper the establishment of public policies to promote the rights of this category of the population. In order to remedy this situation, ONDE is preparing to set up an Observatory Unit, whose main task is to act as a clearing house for information. The aim will be to create an information system containing all the data and indicators relating to the situation of children in the economic, social, cultural and political fields. ONDE has already a detailed dashboard resulting from studies carried out previously, in particular the study on the situation of children in the municipalities. The Observatory has also produced several publications listing indicators on the situation of children in different areas, namely education, health and work. These publications also deal with the problem of children in difficult situations and make available to those concerned a collection of Moroccan legislation concerning the child. In addition to these studies and publications, ONDE also invests in awareness-raising activities in order to awaken and strengthen awareness of the importance of contributing to the protection of children\'s rights',

    'cnde.description' => 'The first National Congress on the Rights of the Child was held in Casablanca in May 1994 at the initiative of Her Royal Highness Princess Lalla Meryem. This first edition of the Congress, placed under the High Patronage of the late His Majesty King Hassan II, brought together all the active forces active in the various fields of childhood, both from civil society and from the ministerial departments concerned. Since then, the National Congress has held its ordinary session every year. Stakeholders involved in the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child are invited to assess the initiatives launched in favour of children in the various fields and to identify new prospects for action. It should be noted that 16 editions have been organised to date. Various themes have been addressed at these meetings, such as the protection of child victims of violence, the generalization of schooling and the fight against illiteracy in rural areas. These major meetings resulted in a panoply of recommendations to guide the public authorities in their efforts to develop strategies and action plans prepared by the government.',

    'campagne.description' => 'No city or country is today free from the phenomenon of children living on the streets.The importance of protecting these children is no longer needs to be demonstrated, especially since they are often victims of all kinds of abuse. ONDE has committed itself in this way by launching the pan-African campaign "For African cities without street children", during the 8th African Summit, which took place in Marrakech in November 2018, under the High Patronage of HM King Mohammed VI and the effective Presidency of Her Royal Highness Princess Lalla Meryem. This initiative, launched in partnership with the United Cities and Local Governments of Africa (UCLG), aims to integrate the issue of children into urban policy, programs and development plans for cities and local territories. The objective is to eradicate this phenomenon in the cities and local and regional territories of African countries. In the long term, the aim is to reduce by at least 20% the number of children living on the streets by 2030. To achieve this, all African government officials and elected representatives were called upon to put in place mechanisms and a plan of action to ensure the protection and reintegration of street children. At the national level, the National Observatory for the Rights of the Child (ONDE) of the Kingdom of Morocco wants to show the way forward by making the capital of the Kingdom, Rabat, a pilot city, a model for Morocco and the African continent. In this way, other cities in the Kingdom and in Africa will be able to design, on the basis of the expertise deployed in Rabat, the strategy best suited to their local specificities.',
