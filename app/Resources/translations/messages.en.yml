        text: "On November 20, 1989, the International Convention on the Rights of the Child sees the light. It is the first text to recognize the rights of the child. The CRC makes the child a subject of rights that affect all areas of life: civil, political, economic, social and cultural. In February 1990, Morocco signed the Convention, confirming the Kingdom's commitment to protect the child."

        title: "The rights of the child establishment at the national level"
        text: "By ratifying this international treaty, the Kingdom has committed itself to guaranteeing the best interests of the child and protecting him/her from all forms of exploitation."
    l1994:
        title: "1994 : Holding of the first edition of the National Congress of the Rights of the Child"
        text: "Morocco is committed to the implementation of the United Nations Convention one year after its ratification. The first initiative in this direction was the holding of the first National Congress on the Rights of the Child under the chairmanship of Her Royal Highness The Princess Lalla Meryem in May 1994 in Casablanca. This first congress brought together all parties involved in the various areas of children's affairs, both from civil society and from ministerial departments, in order to make them aware of the Kingdom's new commitments. '... Our decision to make your congress a national observatory to which will be assigned the task of pursuing the strategy for the implementation of the UN Convention, as well as our appointment of our dear eldest daughter, Princess Lalla Meryem, as its President, stem from our unshakeable faith in the support we wish to give to the associative action that we hope to see become a permanent laudable tradition in our country...'. Extract from the royal message addressed to the second session of the National Congress on the Rights of the Child (1995)."
    l1995:
        title: "1995 : The Congress takes the form of an Observatory"
        text: "The National Congress, established as a mechanism for monitoring the United Nations Convention, has been set up as the National Observatory for the Rights of the Child. This transformation, desired by the late His Majesty King Hassan II, was announced at the second edition of the Congress, held in Kenitra in May 1996. The late His Majesty Hassan II also entrusted the presidency of this new permanent institution to Her Royale Highness Princess Lalla Meryem. The establishment of the Observatory was then seen as an important step in the process of consolidating the actions carried out in the interest of children, thus confirming the Kingdom's desire to create conditions conducive to the enjoyment by children of all their rights."
    l1999_1:
        title: "1999 : Establishment of the center for listening"
        text: "The year 1998 marks a new impetus in the National Observatory for the Rights of the Child’s action. It was during this year that Her Royal Highness Princess Lalla Meryem inaugurated the national listening and protection center for children victims of violence, exploitation and inclusion, with all its mechanisms, in particular the free number '2511'."
    l1999_2:
        title: "1999 : Establishment of the Children’s Parliament"
        text: "In the spring of 1999, and after a long preparatory process, the first session of an essential part of our country's implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child was held: the Children's Parliament. The establishment of this body, which the Observatory sees as a forum for dialogue and consultation among children, is a concrete expression of one of the major recommendations of the National Congress on the Rights of the Child, and meets several objectives. The aim is to provide an opportunity for children of different age groups and from all regions of the Kingdom to have a permanent and structured framework for exchange and debate."

    text2: In Brief
    text3: Children's rights are inalienable and indivisible. It was in this essence that the National Observatory for the Rights of the Child (ONDE) was established by the late King Hassan II in May 1995, two years after Morocco's ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Observatory, chaired by Her Royal Highness Princess Lalla Meryem, has been entrusted with the mission of monitoring the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in order to promote the rights of the child in all areas related to health, education, legislation, leisure and culture, in its material, moral and spiritual dimensions, as stated in article 3 of the Statute of ONDE. ONDE, whose ambition is to speed up the implementation of the CRC, also seeks to guide public policy by contributing to the various debates on all issues affecting children, and plays a crucial role in the harmonization of national legislation.

The aim was to promote the schooling of the girl child in rural areas by providing each rural locality with a water point equipped and fitted out to free girls and women from the chore of fetching water. The operation in numbers/statistics :
            description2: • Supply of drinking water to 150 douar;
            description3: 750,000 inhabitants have benefited from this operation, including 330,000 children

In 1997, ONDE, in partnership with the municipality of Youssoufia in Rabat, initiated a demonstration project involving the development of an omni-sport area for the benefit of children in the Nahda II district. This project very quickly established itself as a central crossroads in the life of the district, and as a meeting point for the children, but also for the adults who accompany them.

protection:
    title: Protection
    description1: An integrated protection of children is vital to their well-being, especially as they are most at risk of violence, abuse and exploitation. Recognizing this imperative, ONDE established a Listening Centre in November 1999 to enable child victims and others to report cases of violence or exploitation. The center offers integrated services, ranging from the reception of complaints to medical and legal support, through its various working tools. These include the toll-free number "0800002511", launched by Her Royal Highness Princess Lalla Meryem on 25 November 1999. In addition to the toll-free number 0800002511, the Listening Center has expanded its working tools with a shortened number "2511" in order to make it easier to remember for the general public.
    description2: These two systems are operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and allow any person, whether adult or a minor, to report acts of abuse and exploitation, in addition to informing the caller of the steps to be taken in terms of care. The center then intervenes with the administrative and judicial bodies concerned to provide direct legal assistance to child victims. The center provides victims with a lawyer free of charge. In the medical and psychosocial field, victims can also benefit from care in the reception units set up in hospitals throughout the Kingdom.
participation:
    title: Participation
    description1: Every citizen has the right to participate in the decision-making process. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by Morocco in June 1993, enshrines this right to participation by children, including those with disabilities. It was with this in mind that ONDE established the Children's Parliament on 25 May 1999, which is now a genuine school for initiation into democratic and civic life. Each child expresses his or her point of view on issues that concern him or her, thus developing his or her dialogue and argumentation skills. In particular, they can express their views on government strategies or draft legislation dealing with children's issues. Regional and national sessions are the meeting point for their participation in civic life. Previous editions have been marked by the reading of a royal letter, which represents a real roadmap for these young parliamentarians.
    description2: "Nous avons érigé l'Observatoire National des Droits de l'Enfant en espace de rencontre où associations, secteurs gouvernementaux et experts se concertent sur le suivi de l`application de la Convention des Nations Unis dans ce domaine et Nous avons fait du Parlement de l'Enfant une institution permanente, que Nous voulons une école d’initiation à la démocratie et dont Nous avons confié la Présidence à Notre sœur Son Altesse Royale La Princesse Lalla Meryem. <span style='font-size:14px;'>Extrait du message de Sa Majesté le Roi Mohammed VI, janvier 2001.</span>"

    title: Health
    description: Access to health care is an inalienable right. Based on this principle, enshrined in the International Convention, ONDE works to protect children from birth through several actions including the organization of national vaccination campaigns. Every year, Her Royal Highness Princess Lalla Meryem kicks off this operation aimed at strengthening children's immune defenses. Since then, significant progress has been made in terms of vaccination. The vaccination rate is estimated at 95%, according to statistics from the Ministry of Health.
observatoire:
    title: Monitoring and follow-up
    description: The scattered nature of the data and information on the situation of children in Morocco may hamper the establishment of public policies to promote the rights of this category of the population. In order to remedy this situation, ONDE is preparing to set up an Observatory Unit, whose main task is to act as a clearing house for information. The aim will be to create an information system containing all the data and indicators relating to the situation of children in the economic, social, cultural and political fields. ONDE has already a detailed dashboard resulting from studies carried out previously, in particular the study on the situation of children in the municipalities. The Observatory has also produced several publications listing indicators on the situation of children in different areas, namely education, health and work. These publications also deal with the problem of children in difficult situations and make available to those concerned a collection of Moroccan legislation concerning the child. In addition to these studies and publications, ONDE also invests in awareness-raising activities in order to awaken and strengthen awareness of the importance of contributing to the protection of children's rights

    title: National Congress on the Rights of the Child
    description: The first National Congress on the Rights of the Child was held in Casablanca in May 1994 at the initiative of Her Royal Highness Princess Lalla Meryem. This first edition of the Congress, placed under the High Patronage of the late His Majesty King Hassan II, brought together all the active forces active in the various fields of childhood, both from civil society and from the ministerial departments concerned. Since then, the National Congress has held its ordinary session every year. Stakeholders involved in the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child are invited to assess the initiatives launched in favour of children in the various fields and to identify new prospects for action. It should be noted that 16 editions have been organised to date. Various themes have been addressed at these meetings, such as the protection of child victims of violence, the generalization of schooling and the fight against illiteracy in rural areas. These major meetings resulted in a panoply of recommendations to guide the public authorities in their efforts to develop strategies and action plans prepared by the government.
campagne:
    title: Campaign “African Cities Without Street Children”
    description: No city or country is today free from the phenomenon of children living on the streets.The importance of protecting these children is no longer needs to be demonstrated, especially since they are often victims of all kinds of abuse. ONDE has committed itself in this way by launching the pan-African campaign "For African cities without street children", during the 8th African Summit, which took place in Marrakech in November 2018, under the High Patronage of HM King Mohammed VI and the effective Presidency of Her Royal Highness Princess Lalla Meryem. This initiative, launched in partnership with the United Cities and Local Governments of Africa (UCLG), aims to integrate the issue of children into urban policy, programs and development plans for cities and local territories. The objective is to eradicate this phenomenon in the cities and local and regional territories of African countries. In the long term, the aim is to reduce by at least 20% the number of children living on the streets by 2030. To achieve this, all African government officials and elected representatives were called upon to put in place mechanisms and a plan of action to ensure the protection and reintegration of street children. At the national level, the National Observatory for the Rights of the Child (ONDE) of the Kingdom of Morocco wants to show the way forward by making the capital of the Kingdom, Rabat, a pilot city, a model for Morocco and the African continent. In this way, other cities in the Kingdom and in Africa will be able to design, on the basis of the expertise deployed in Rabat, the strategy best suited to their local specificities.
